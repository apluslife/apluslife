## MVP Scope

The Minimum Viable Product consists of **User Story 1 only** (Member Authentication), which provides:
- User registration and login
- Role-based access control
- Session management
- Basic security features

This MVP delivers immediate value by establishing user identity and access control, which is the foundation for all other features.
