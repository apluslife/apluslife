# Feature Specification: A-Plus Life Community Platform

**Feature Branch**: `001-apluslife-platform`
**Created**: 2025-10-22
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "A-Plus Life community platform with member management, board system, and user activity logging"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Member Authentication and Profile Management (Priority: P1)

Users can register, log in, and manage their member profiles in the A-Plus Life platform. The system supports two types of members: Life members (linked to an external Life membership system) and normal members.

**Why this priority**: Authentication is the foundational capability that all other features depend on. Without user authentication, no personalized features can function.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating a new member account, logging in with credentials, viewing profile information, and logging out. Delivers immediate value by allowing users to establish their identity in the system.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a new user visits the platform, **When** they provide valid registration details (ID, password, name, email), **Then** their account is created and they can log in
2. **Given** a registered user with valid credentials, **When** they submit login information, **Then** they are authenticated and granted access based on their role (Admin or User)
3. **Given** a Life member with a customer number, **When** they register, **Then** their account is linked to their Life membership
4. **Given** an authenticated user, **When** they view their profile, **Then** they can see their name, email, member type, and membership status
5. **Given** a withdrawn member, **When** they attempt to log in, **Then** access is denied with appropriate notification

### User Story 2 - Board Content Creation and Management (Priority: P2)

Users can create, view, edit, and delete board posts with file attachments. Administrators can mark posts as notices for prominent display.

**Why this priority**: Board functionality enables community engagement and information sharing, which is the core value proposition of the platform after basic authentication.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by logging in as a user, creating a new board post with a title and content, optionally attaching files, viewing the post, editing it, and deleting it. Admin users can additionally mark posts as notices.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an authenticated user, **When** they create a new post with title and content, **Then** the post is saved and visible in the board list
2. **Given** a user viewing a post, **When** they open it, **Then** the view count increments and they can see the full content
3. **Given** the post author, **When** they edit their post, **Then** the changes are saved and the modified date is updated
4. **Given** the post author or an admin, **When** they delete a post, **Then** it is marked as deleted and no longer visible to regular users
5. **Given** an admin user, **When** they mark a post as a notice, **Then** it appears prominently at the top of the board
6. **Given** a user creating a post, **When** they attach files, **Then** the files are stored and accessible when viewing the post

### User Story 3 - User Activity Monitoring and Audit Trail (Priority: P3)

The system automatically logs all significant user actions including logins, content creation, modifications, and deletions for security auditing and user behavior analysis.

**Why this priority**: Activity logging provides security oversight and helps administrators understand user engagement patterns. It's important but not essential for basic platform operation.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by performing various actions (login, create post, edit post) as a user, then viewing the activity logs as an administrator to verify all actions were recorded with timestamps, IP addresses, and action details.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user logs into the system, **When** authentication completes, **Then** a login action log is created with timestamp, IP address, and user agent
2. **Given** a user creates, edits, or deletes content, **When** the action completes, **Then** the action is logged with details of what was changed
3. **Given** an administrator, **When** they review activity logs, **Then** they can filter by user, action type, date range, and see complete audit trails
4. **Given** a failed action (e.g., failed login, error during post creation), **When** the failure occurs, **Then** it is logged with error details for troubleshooting

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a user tries to access a deleted post directly via URL?
- How does the system handle concurrent edits to the same post by multiple users?
- What happens when file upload fails during post creation?
- How are orphaned files cleaned up when posts are deleted?
- What happens when a Life member's customer number changes in the external system?
- How does the system handle password reset for users who forgot their credentials?
- What happens when activity log storage approaches capacity limits?
- How are timezone differences handled for users in different regions?
